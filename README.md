# Motion-Activated-Sanitizer-Dispenser
The current COVID crisis has inspired ingenuity on the part of makers - in deploying technology to meet new challenges.  The humble store-bought sanitizer has become a vital aid in battling virusesâ€”yet it still requires touch to operate, something which isn't ideal for safe use.  Today, I'll show you how to modify your out of the box dispenser with some compact technology to go touch-free! No need to push a button anymore, just wave your hand in front of the sensor, and the sanitizer liquid is automatically pumped into your palm.  
Hardware required:  - Store-bought sanitizer dispenser - Arduino Uno - Servo motor - Infrared sensor - A few jumper cables  
Software required: - Arduino IDE
